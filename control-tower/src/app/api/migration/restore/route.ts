/**
 * Instance backup upload for restore (E64), streamed.
 *
 * The catch-all proxy buffers a request body with `req.text()`, which would
 * corrupt a binary archive. This route streams the upload straight to the
 * engine, which verifies it and stages it for the next restart. The engine's
 * answer is small JSON and is returned as-is, including a 409 that asks the
 * operator to confirm overwriting an instance that already has trades.
 *
 * `/api/migration/restore/apply` and `/discard` are ordinary JSON calls and
 * still go through the catch-all.
