/**
 * First-run venue choice, shown before anything else on a multi-venue image.
 *
 * This exists because of an ordering bug rather than for polish. The risk gate
 * that follows records a jurisdiction acknowledgment stamped with the venue the
 * engine is running, and that record is write-once — "the first acknowledgment
 * is the record of legal significance". While first boot seeded a default of
 * Polymarket International, a US buyer was shown a gate telling them the
 * International CLOB is not available to US persons, had to accept it to get
 * any further, and thereby filed a permanent acknowledgment against a venue
 * they may not legally trade.
 *
 * So the choice comes first, and the acknowledgment is made against the venue
 * the operator actually picked.
 *
 * Only rendered when the image carries more than one venue and none has been
 * chosen. A single-venue build has nothing to ask.
