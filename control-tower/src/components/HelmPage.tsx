/**
 * The Helm view — DRADIS's record of why a trade was entered.
 *
 * Every other viper's rationale lives in its source and its config. A Helm
 * intent instead carries what the operator believed, how strongly, what would
 * have proved them wrong, and what the LLM said about that reasoning before the
 * money went in. None of that fits a trade row, which is why this is its own
 * screen rather than a section of the Tradelog: the log answers what executed,
 * this answers why it was entered.
 *
 * The page is ordered by what it is for. Live intents first, because those are
 * operations with money committed. Then the resolved record, read deliberately
 * against what actually happened. Calibration last, and only once enough
 * intents have resolved to mean anything.
