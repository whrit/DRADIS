/**
 * HTTP Basic Auth for Control Tower, shared by `middleware.ts` and by the routes
 * that have to opt out of middleware.
 *
 * The restore upload cannot go through middleware: Next.js clones the request
 * body for any middleware-matched route and truncates that clone at
 * `middlewareClientMaxBodySize` (10 MB by default), silently, which cut a 71 MB
 * backup down to 10 MB mid-migration. The clone also ignores stream
 * backpressure, so simply raising the limit would buffer the whole archive in
 * memory twice. That route is excluded from the matcher instead and calls
 * `basicAuthFailure` itself, so excluding it costs no authentication.

 * Returns a 401 response when the request does not carry valid credentials, or

 * Auth is skipped entirely when CT_USERNAME / CT_PASSWORD are not set, so local
