/**
 * HTTP Basic Auth middleware for Control Tower.
 *
 * Triggered on every request except static assets.
 * Auth is SKIPPED entirely when CT_USERNAME / CT_PASSWORD are not set in the
 * environment — so local dev (start-local.sh) works with zero config.
 *
 * Production usage — set in your server's .env or Docker run command:
 *   CT_USERNAME=admin
 *   CT_PASSWORD=your-strong-password

  //
  // `api/migration/restore` is excluded for a different reason: Next.js clones the
  // request body for every middleware-matched route and silently truncates that
  // clone at `middlewareClientMaxBodySize` (10 MB), which cut a 71 MB backup upload
  // down to 10 MB. The route checks Basic Auth itself, so it stays protected.
  // The `$` matters: without it the exclusion is a prefix and would also drop
  // `restore/apply` and `restore/discard`, which restart the engine, out of auth.
