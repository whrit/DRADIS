/// 24h defer window, multiplied by the stale-row population (Kalshi runs seven
/// squadrons against one shard, each sweeping the same pool-wide row set) and
/// by the fill-driven extra sweeps. All of that sits in the trading loop, so a
/// slow venue turned settlement lookups into tick delay. The same per-row loop
/// was fine on the intl chain-sync path because that sweep runs every 300s in
/// a background task; the cost model does not carry to a 30s in-loop tick.
///
/// Mechanism: exponential per-token backoff on consecutive `Unknown` answers
/// (30s, 60s, 120s, … capped at [`PROBE_MAX_DELAY_SECS`]). A token inside its
/// backoff window is DEFERRED without a venue call — exactly the treatment a
/// fresh `Unknown` gets, so nothing is booked or deleted on a skipped probe. A
/// decisive answer (`Resolved`/`NotClosed`) clears the entry, and a token
/// never seen before probes immediately, so the first lookup after a position
/// vanishes — the one that books the normal settlement — is never delayed.
///
/// Deliberately in-memory and NOT the correctness bound: this state dies on
/// restart, which only means one immediate re-probe per deferred token and a
/// rebuilt backoff — more calls, never a missed settlement. The durable bound
/// remains the row-age check against `SETTLEMENT_DEFER_MAX_SECS` in the
/// sweeps, precisely because attempt counters that die on restart were
/// rejected as a bound when the age check was designed.
