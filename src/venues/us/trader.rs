//! US retail trading loop — venue-neutral strategy execution over the
//! [`Execution`] trait.
//!
//! The loop is **data-driven**: it classifies the selected market, asks the
//! taxonomy which vipers are meaningful for that market class
//! (`db::vipers_for_class`), and runs exactly those strategy impls through the
//! shared orchestrator (`evaluate_strategies`). Whatever signals they emit are
//! dispatched onto the venue via [`Execution::place_atomic`] /
//! [`Execution::place_order`], honoring each signal's time-in-force.
//!
//! Flow:
//!   1. discover an active binary market (`GET /v1/markets`),
//!   2. classify it and resolve its eligible vipers,
//!   3. stream both legs' order books over the [`ws`] feed,
//!   4. each tick, build a venue-neutral [`StrategyContext`] and evaluate the
//!      resolved strategies, dispatching their signals to the venue.
//!
//! Order lifecycle (Option A — reconciliation-based): resting (`Gtc`/`Gtd`)
//! orders are tracked in an [`OpenOrders`] set and reconciled every
//! [`LIFECYCLE_SYNC_SECS`] against the venue's positions endpoint —
//! **confirming** fills (no fabricated fills), **cancelling** stale unfilled
//! orders ([`STALE_ORDER_SECS`]), and **flattening** any naked leg whose hedge
//! partner neither filled nor still rests. All tracked orders are cancelled on
//! stand-down / rotation. (Intl uses on-chain balance polling for the same job;
//! a shared `OrderLifecycle` over an extended `Execution` trait is the eventual
//! Option C convergence.)
