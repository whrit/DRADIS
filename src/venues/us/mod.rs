//! US retail venue — custodial, CFTC-regulated Polymarket US platform.
//!
//! Web2 custodial execution (per-request Ed25519 signatures via the `X-PM-*`
//! headers) against `api.prod.polymarketexchange.com`. No `alloy`, no Polymarket
//! SDK, no EIP-712 — all crypto identity is the portal API key in [`auth::UsAuth`].
//!
//! ## Market identity
//! The neutral [`MarketId`] carries the instrument **symbol**
//! (e.g. `tec-nfl-sbw-2026-02-08-kc-yes`) — the id the positions feed, the WS
//! streams, and the batched-order token arrays all use. The live API accepts
//! symbol-addressed orders via `outcomeSide` + `action` (the older
//! `market_slug` + `intent` pairing is no longer required), so the venue derives
//! the outcome leg directly from the symbol with a pure mapping — no network
//! catalog round-trip (decision D5).
//!
//! Spec: `docs/us_retail_api.md` + live-API order-routing/auth update.
