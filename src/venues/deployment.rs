//! Venue-neutral deployment queue consumer.
//!
//! The Control Tower's deploy endpoint writes a row to `deployment_queue`; a
//! consumer picks it up and runs the market. That consumer was written for
//! Kalshi and lived in its trader, so Polymarket US — which had no consumer at
//! all — refused every deploy while still offering a Deploy button, and the
//! intl CLOB used a third, unrelated path.
//!
//! Almost none of the machinery was ever venue-specific. Requeueing interrupted
//! rows, claiming one so a second tick cannot start it twice, the status
//! transitions, the auto-deploy seeder and its dedupe are all queue mechanics.
//! Exactly two things differ per venue: turning a market id into something the
//! venue can trade, and choosing a market for a class. Those are the two methods
//! of [`DeploymentRunner`]; everything else lives here once.
