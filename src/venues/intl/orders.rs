//! Intl CLOB order placement helpers (EIP-712 signing over Polygon).
//!
//! Moved here from `helpers/orders.rs` as part of the venue-abstraction seam
//! (see `docs/VENUE_ABSTRACTION.md`, Step 1). The self-custody signing machinery
//! is venue-specific and now lives under `venues::intl`. `helpers::orders`
//! re-exports these symbols for backward compatibility with existing call sites.
//!
//! Provides generic order placement functions that work with any strategy,
//! token, or direction (buy/sell), including an atomic two-leg batch variant
//! that uses Polymarket's `/orders` endpoint to submit both legs simultaneously.
