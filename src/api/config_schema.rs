//! Control Tower config schema registry.
//!
//! Single source of truth describing every editable `DynamicConfig` field, so the
//! Control Tower can render the Basic panels **and** a dynamic "Advanced" modal from
//! one place — with no hand-maintained frontend field list to drift out of sync.
//!
//! Roadmap: "Schema-driven Advanced modal (Option B)". Served at
//! `GET /api/config/schema`. The frontend groups by `group`, shows `advanced=false`
//! fields in the Basic panel (as today) and `advanced=true` fields in the modal,
//! using `value_type` + `min`/`max`/`step` for input rendering and clamping.
//!
//! NOTE: `key` MUST match the serde field name in `DynamicConfig` (snake_case) —
//! that is exactly what `PATCH /api/squadrons/{id}/config` merges. Keep this registry
//! in lock-step with `helpers::dynamic_config::DynamicConfig`; a future improvement is
//! to derive it via a proc-macro so it can never drift.

/// Which configuration row a field actually lives in.
///
/// DRADIS has two config scopes that look identical in the schema and behave
/// completely differently: the global `dynamic_config` row, and each deployed
/// squadron's `squadron_configs` row. Nothing recorded which one a field
/// belonged to, so a field could be RENDERED at one scope and READ at the other
/// and no part of the system would notice.
///
/// It went unnoticed three times. `arb_settle_grace_secs` rendered in the
/// Arbitrage card (per-squadron) and was read from the global row, so editing
/// "Orphan Settle Grace" wrote a row nobody read. `llm_max_output_tokens`
/// rendered in the Deployment panel and was never read at all — every provider
/// call used the compile-time constant, while its help text told operators to
/// raise it. `intl_taker_fee_rate` was read at BOTH scopes, so one round trip could
/// book at two different fee rates; every reader now takes the global row.
///
/// Declared per GROUP rather than per field because the group already decides
/// where the UI renders a field, and the two must agree by construction: the
/// Control Tower renders `Deployment` in Setup, and `Order Book` plus
/// `Exit Accounting` plus the viper-named groups on a squadron page.
