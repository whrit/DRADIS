/// Peripheral tasks spawned by `Squadron::patrol()` — Phase 3f-4.
///
/// Each function spawns one independent Tokio task that runs at its own cadence
/// until the `peripheral_cancel` token fires.  Lifting these out of the main
/// `select!` loop means:
///
///   • A 45 s cleanup cycle can no longer delay strategy evaluation ticks.
///   • Status, settlement, and pulse tasks run on their own schedules without
///     being held back by a stalled `.await` elsewhere in the loop.
///   • The core `select!` in `patrol()` shrinks to three arms:
///     `cancel`, `market_rx.changed()`, and `ticker` (strategy evaluation).
///
/// **Lifecycle contract**: tasks stop when `peripheral_cancel` fires.
/// `patrol()` fires it before returning so no task outlives a market rotation.
///
/// **Watchdog contract**: `spawn_watchdog_task` accepts the patrol's own
/// `cancel` token.  When it detects loop silence it calls `cancel.cancel()`,
/// which triggers the `cancel.cancelled()` arm in `patrol()`'s `select!` and
/// causes the patrol to stand down and restart in the outer `'market_loop`.
