/// FairValue Strategy — analytic binary-option pricing (2026-08-05)
///
/// # Thesis
///
/// A Polymarket up/down market is a cash-or-nothing binary option. Its fair
/// value has a closed form (drift ≈ 0 over intraday horizons):
///
///   P(S_T > K) = Φ( ln(S/K) / (σ·√T) )
///
/// where S = oracle spot, K = strike, σ = realized vol of oracle log-returns
/// (per √second, self-sampled), T = seconds to expiry. Retail flow prices
/// these markets by vibes; this viper prices them by math and buys whichever
/// side trades at a discount to model fair value.
///
/// # Two regimes, one model
///
/// * **Mid-session**: vol-estimate error is material → demand a wide edge
///   (FAIRVALUE_BASE_EDGE, default 8¢ net of fees).
/// * **Endgame ("settlement snipe")**: √T collapses, the model approaches a
///   step function, and Polymarket's fee (rate·p·(1−p)) collapses with it.
///   The edge requirement tapers to FAIRVALUE_MIN_EDGE, naturally producing
///   entries like "ask $0.96 for a side the model prices at 0.999".
///   A pin-risk guard refuses endgame entries when the spot is within
///   FAIRVALUE_PIN_MIN_SIGMA σ-distances of the strike — the coin-flip zone
///   where one loss at $0.97 erases ~30 wins.
///
/// # Exits
///
/// 1. TP at FAIRVALUE_TARGET_PROFIT_PERCENT — except inside the settlement
///    window with the model still ≥ SETTLE_HOLD_MIN_PROB, where holding to
///    settlement pays $1.00 with zero exit fee (strictly dominates a taker TP).
/// 2. SL at FAIRVALUE_STOP_LOSS_PERCENT (min-hold gated, catastrophic bypass).
/// 3. Model reversal: our side's fair probability has decayed by
///    `fairvalue_model_reversal_decay_pct` from where it stood at entry — the
///    thesis is gone, exit without waiting for the SL. The trigger is
///    **entry-relative**, not an absolute floor: this viper's whole job is to
///    buy a side the model prices above its ask, and on a cheap tail that fair
///    value is legitimately low (0.30 against a 0.18 ask). An absolute floor
///    of 0.40 made every such entry exit-eligible the moment it filled, so the
///    position was closed by the 60s min-hold rather than by any change of
///    thesis (observed 2026-08-12: three round trips, all exited at exactly
///    t+60s, the one "winner" saved only by TP firing at t+10s).
/// 4. Endgame bail-out: final BAIL_SECS with fair probability < BAIL_PROB.
///
/// # Settlement-snipe posture (`fairvalue_settle_snipe_hold`)
///
/// Rule 1 is unreachable once entry × (1 + TP) ≥ $1.00 — $0.8333 at the
/// shipped 20% — because no such price exists on a binary contract. Above
/// that line the position's only profit path is settlement, and rule 2 is the
/// wrong instrument: a price that is also a probability touches a 15% stop
/// from $0.92 with probability (1 − 0.92)/(1 − 0.78) ≈ 36% under the market's
/// own pricing, against an 8% chance of actually settling at $0. Observed
/// 2026-09-06: NO at $0.92 stopped at $0.78 for −$0.79 with the model still at
/// 0.846; the market recovered within a minute and settled at $1.00.
///
/// So for those entries the percentage stop stands down and the position is
/// managed on the model's own EV test instead: sell only when the bid, net of
/// the taker fee, is worth at least what the model says settlement is worth.
/// That single rule is both the stop (thesis broken: model below market) and
/// the take-profit (market overpaying versus the model), and its failure mode
/// is cheap — a spurious fire sells at roughly fair value and costs one fee.
/// The catastrophic stop (2× the width) is kept as insurance against a stale
/// or broken model, which the EV test cannot see because it trusts the model;
/// a position with no model reading falls back to the price stop for the same
/// reason a model that cannot price does not get to veto one.
///
/// # Resting take-profit (`fairvalue_resting_tp_enabled`)
///
/// Rule 1 used to cross to the bid with a FAK and pay the taker fee a second
/// time. Across the first five live trades (2026-09-06) direction was a coin
/// flip and the entire net loss was transaction cost. The exit half of that
/// toll can rest: a post-only ask at entry × (1 + TP) is lifted only when the
/// market runs through the price rule 1 would have sold at anyway, so being
/// filled carries none of the adverse selection a resting BID does. Once the
/// fill is confirmed the viper emits [`StrategySignal::MakerRestingExit`] at
/// that price every tick, deferred behind every hard exit so a stop on any
/// position still wins the tick. The patrol owns the order: it places it once,
/// leaves it alone while the price is unchanged, pulls it before any FAK exit
/// needs the shares, and books the lift at the resting price net of the
/// entry fee. Rule 1 is unchanged and still fires if the bid reaches the target
/// while no ask rests (or before a lift has been confirmed on-chain).

/// Records, for every position the percentage stop closes, what holding those
/// shares to settlement would have returned instead. Observe-only: the live
/// stop keeps firing and nothing here emits a signal or places an order.
///
/// # Why this exists
///
/// On production (Polymarket International, 30 real FairValue round trips) every
/// dollar of net loss sat in the 14 stop exits (−$14.54, 78% of the viper's fee
/// spend), while the 8 holds to settlement made +$7.83. That split is
/// survivorship-biased by construction — the stop selects the bad paths and
/// settlement the good ones — so it cannot say whether the stop is saving money
/// or spending it. The sports lane already runs the other posture
/// (`SPORTS_FAIRVALUE_SETTLE_HOLD`: hold, catastrophic floor armed) on the
/// argument that a percentage stop "measures a different strategy". This
/// recorder measures that strategy on the crypto positions the stop actually
/// closed, against the venue's own resolution, so the decision can be made on
/// the stopped paths rather than on the survivors.
///
/// # What is recorded, and from where
///
/// * **The row opens on a booked stop FILL**, not on the stop signal: a stop
///   FAK can miss and re-fire for minutes, and the counterfactual must start
///   from the price the venue actually paid, net of the fees it actually
///   charged. The patrol reports every booked exit slice through
///   [`crate::orchestrator::Strategy::on_exit_filled`]; only reasons that begin
///   `FairValueSL:` or `FairValueCatastrophicSL:` open a row. The floor the
///   live rule priced on rides along from the stop's own emission
///   (`note_emission`, rule 4), so the counterfactual uses the same
///   `entry × (1 − 2 × stop)` the live floor would have.
/// * **The resolution comes from the venue**, by the same Gamma rule the sports
///   ledger and GBoost's shadow lane use (`settled_prices_for_market`: $0 or
///   $1 outright, $0.50 only when UMA reports `resolved`). Not from the oracle:
///   the model's strike and Binance print are an approximation of the venue's
///   resolution source, and a measurement meant to settle a real-money
///   question should not inherit the model's own errors. The probe starts
///   `SETTLE_GRACE_SECS` after the stated close and gives up after
///   `GIVE_UP_SECS`, leaving the row `unresolved` with no number.
/// * **The path after the stop is followed from the book the stop read**, at
///   tick cadence, for as long as the squadron quotes the market: lowest and
///   highest bid, when the bid was last seen, and the first instant the bid
///   reached the catastrophic floor. The hourly squadron rotates at the close,
///   so coverage runs to the close in the ordinary case; `last_bid_at` says
///   how far it actually ran for each row.
///
/// # Two counterfactuals, not one
///
/// `hold_pnl` is the pure hold: settlement value less entry, less the entry
/// fee already paid; settlement pays no exit fee. `hold_floor_pnl` keeps the
/// catastrophic floor armed, as the sports posture does: if the bid reached
/// `floor_price` after the stop (and was sellable — above `Min Exit Bid`), the
/// counterfactual sells there as a taker, fee charged; otherwise it is the pure
/// hold. For a live catastrophic stop the floor-armed counterfactual IS the
/// live trade, so `hold_floor_pnl == stop_pnl` there and only `hold_pnl` adds
/// information. The faithful comparison for "turn the percentage stop off,
/// keep the floor" is `hold_floor_pnl − stop_pnl` summed over scored rows; the
/// pure hold answers the stricter "no stop at all" the sports comment
/// describes. The floor is modeled from the book at tick cadence, which is
/// how the live floor reads it; a flicker shorter than one tick is invisible
/// to both.
///
/// # Re-entry
///
/// On the shipped profiles a stop trips the market's circuit breaker
/// (`FAIRVALUE_MAX_STOP_LOSSES_PER_MARKET = 1`), so FairValue does not re-enter
/// a market it was stopped on and the counterfactual's capital is never
/// double-counted. The breaker is a knob, so the sweep also flags a row whose
/// token FairValue re-entered live after the stop (`live_reentered`); those
/// rows are a different experiment (the hold would have occupied the capital
/// the re-entry used) and the summary counts them so they can be set aside.
///
/// # What the record will not say
///
/// It scores the exact shares the stop sold, at the venue's resolution, with
/// the fees the venue charges. It does not model what the hold would have done
/// to the REST of the book: capital held to settlement is capital the viper
/// could not deploy on the next entry under `Max Exposure`, and that
/// portfolio effect is outside a per-position record. It also does not model
/// the live rules that would still have been armed under a hold — the model
/// reversal exit, the endgame bail, the resting take-profit — so the two
/// columns bracket the hold posture rather than reproduce the sports lane
/// rule for rule. And the sample is the stops the live rule fired, under the
/// live rule's entry filters; a decision to change the stop also changes
/// which positions exist to be stopped.
