# build-ami.sh — builds a DRADIS AWS Marketplace AMI from the current repo.
#
# ONE AMI for ONE Marketplace listing. The image carries a binary for every
# venue (Polymarket International, Polymarket US, Kalshi) and the customer
# picks theirs in the Setup view; see deploy/entrypoint.sh for the dispatch.
#
#   ./deploy/ami/build-ami.sh                      → all three venues
#   ./deploy/ami/build-ami.sh --venues "intl us"   → shorter test build
#
# What it does (everything is created fresh and torn down afterwards):
#   1. Resolves the latest Canonical Ubuntu 24.04 LTS base AMI via public SSM
#   2. Creates a throwaway key pair + security group (SSH from your IP only)
#   3. Launches a builder instance, uploads a clean `git archive` of HEAD
#      (tracked files only — .env / data / secrets can never leak into the AMI)
#   4. Runs provision.sh: Docker, engine + Control Tower images, /opt/dradis,
#      systemd unit (enabled, not started — first boot belongs to the customer)
#   5. Marketplace hygiene sweep: authorized_keys, SSH host keys, shell
#      histories, machine-id, cloud-init state, logs
#   6. Stops the instance, snapshots it into an AMI, terminates + cleans up
#
# Requirements: aws CLI v2 with credentials, git, ssh, a default VPC in REGION.
#
# Options:
#   --profile NAME         AWS CLI profile (or set AWS_PROFILE)
#   --venues "LIST"        default: "intl us kalshi" (space-separated)
#   --region REGION        default: us-east-1 (where Marketplace sources AMIs)
#   --instance-type TYPE   default: c5.4xlarge (16 vCPU — three Rust builds)
#   --version LABEL        default: git describe (AMI name suffix)
#   --keep-instance        don't terminate the builder on failure (debugging)
# =============================================================================
