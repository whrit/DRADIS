# Contributing to DRADIS

Pull requests are welcome. DRADIS trades real money, so the bar for changes to
the execution path is high — please read this before opening one.

## Licensing and the CLA

DRADIS is **dual-licensed**: AGPL-3.0 for open-source use, with commercial
licenses available for hosted/SaaS and proprietary deployments (see
[README](../README.md#license)).

That model only works if the maintainer holds the right to license *every* line
in the tree under both sets of terms — including code you write. So before your
first pull request can be merged, you'll be asked to sign the
[Contributor License Agreement](CLA.md).

It's a one-time, automated step: a bot comments on your pull request with a link
and the exact phrase to reply with. You keep ownership of your contribution; the
CLA grants a license, it does not assign copyright.

**If you write code on an employer's time or equipment**, please check Section 4
of the CLA before signing. In many jurisdictions that work belongs to your
employer by default, which means it isn't yours to license.

## Before you open a pull request

Run the checks the CI runs:

```bash
# Rust — all three venue builds must compile, since only one is active per build
cargo test --verbose
cargo check --no-default-features --features us_retail
cargo check --no-default-features --features kalshi

# Control Tower
cd control-tower && pnpm check && pnpm build
```

A change that compiles under the default `intl_clob` feature can still break the
`us_retail` or `kalshi` builds — the venue feature gates are mutually exclusive,
so please check all three.

## Commit messages

Please do **not** include AI co-author trailers — `Co-Authored-By: Claude ...`,
`Co-Authored-By: Copilot ...` or similar — in commit messages.

This is not a position on using AI assistance; use whatever tools you like. It is
about what the trailer does on GitHub: those addresses resolve to real GitHub
accounts, so a commit carrying one renders with the assistant as a linked
contributor avatar beside the humans who wrote the code. DRADIS credits people.

If you use an assistant that adds the trailer automatically, strip it before
pushing — `git commit --amend` on the last commit, or an interactive rebase for
older ones.

## Config files

`src/config.rs` is gitignored and holds live tuning. If you add a constant there,
add it to **all three** of `src/config.conservative.rs.example`,
`src/config.balanced.rs.example`, and `src/config.aggressive.rs.example` — those
are the committed templates, and CI builds from the balanced profile.

If the constant should be tunable at runtime, wire it as a `DynamicConfig` field
rather than a bare constant, register it in `src/api/config_schema.rs`, and
regenerate `src/profiles.json` with `python3 tools/generate-profiles.py`.

## Changes to the execution path

For anything touching order placement, fill accounting, or P&L
(`src/squadron/patrol_impl.rs`, `src/venues/`), please describe in the pull
request:

- what the venue actually returns, not what the docs say it returns, and
- how you verified it — a log excerpt from a demo/ghost run is ideal.

Several past bugs in this area were silent: the code compiled, the numbers looked
plausible, and the error only surfaced as a slow P&L drift. Ghost mode
(`GHOST_MODE = true` in `config.rs`) and Kalshi's demo environment
(`KALSHI_DEMO=1`) both let you exercise these paths without risking funds.

## Strategy changes

If you change a Viper's entry or exit logic, say which live trades motivated it.
The config files carry dated triage comments explaining why each threshold is
what it is — please add to that record rather than replacing values silently.

## Third-party and vendor-backed Raptors

DRADIS welcomes new signal sources. Where one lives — in this tree, or in a
separate add-ons repository — depends on what the engine is being asked to carry,
not on who wrote it. Plenty of good code comes from outside, and the test below
has nothing to do with authorship.

A Raptor belongs **in core** when:

- its feed is reachable without the operator holding an account with a paid
  third-party service, or it has a free tier that is genuinely usable for the
  default poll cadence; and
- something in DRADIS consumes it — a Viper's entry or exit, a gate, or a sizing
  decision. A Raptor that publishes a snapshot nothing reads is surface area
  without a decision behind it; and
- it needs no payment credential, wallet, or signing key of its own. The engine
  already holds venue keys, and each additional signing path is a larger attack
  surface in a process that moves money.

A Raptor belongs in an **add-ons repository** when its signal depends on the
contributor's own commercial service, when no Viper consumes it, or when it asks
the engine to pay per call. This is not a judgment about quality. It is that
every Raptor in core is one DRADIS maintains forever — its config knobs, its
Control Tower surface, its tests, its three venue builds — and one that ships in
the AWS Marketplace image, which means DRADIS warrants it to paying customers and
answers the support ticket when the vendor's tier changes.

Integrating by interface rather than by merge is usually the better outcome for
both sides. `RAPTOR_SOURCES` in `src/api/setup.rs` is deliberately data-driven: a
Raptor registered there appears in the Setup panel with no front-end change, with
its credential field, its signup link, its poll cadence and its free-tier
arithmetic. The `SportsCatalog` trait in `src/raptors/sports_ledger.rs` is the
same idea for per-venue market matching. An add-on built against those seams gets
the same operator experience without DRADIS taking on the maintenance.

Two things that will be refused regardless of where the code lives:

- **A feed whose unconfigured state publishes fictional numbers.** Sample or demo
  data that looks like a price is the failure mode this codebase has been bitten
  by repeatedly: an absent ask published as `$1.00` produced a nonsense mid, and a
  line that had gone stale still read as current. A flag saying `sample_data =
  true` is not protection, because the next consumer is the one that forgets to
  check it. With no key, a Raptor must publish a neutral snapshot and report
  itself disconnected.
- **A signal that gates live money on an external service.** Measurement from a
  third party is welcome as a recorded observation. It must not sit in the path
  that decides whether an order is placed or a config change is applied, because
  that hands part of the risk gate to someone else's uptime.

The Tennis Raptor predates this policy. It is kept rather than removed, and it is
why the policy is written down.

If you are not sure which side of the line your idea falls on, open an issue
before writing the code. A short conversation is cheaper than a PR either of us
has to walk back.
