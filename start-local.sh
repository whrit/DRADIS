# start-local.sh — Runs DRADIS + Control Tower locally for development
#
# Usage:
#   ./start-local.sh             # intl CLOB, BTC (default)
#   ./start-local.sh eth         # intl CLOB, ETH
#   VENUE=us ./start-local.sh    # US Retail venue (us_retail build)
#   VENUE=kalshi ./start-local.sh # Kalshi venue (kalshi build)
#   RUST_LOG=debug ./start-local.sh
#
# Venue selection (VENUE env var):
#   intl  → default build (international CLOB, self-custody)   [requires POLYMARKET_PRIVATE_KEY + POLYGON_RPC_URL]
#   us    → us_retail build (US Retail, custodial API key)     [requires POLYMARKET_US_KEY_ID + POLYMARKET_US_SECRET_KEY]
#
# Logs:
#   logs/dradis-local.log     ← DRADIS output
#   Control Tower prints to terminal (hot reload)
#
# Stop both:
#   ./stop-local.sh   OR   Ctrl+C followed by: kill $(cat .dradis-local.pid)

# Forcing NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL='' here OVERRIDES any value in control-tower/.env.local

# The proxy reads DRADIS_API_KEY from the environment. It is inherited here from .env
# (sourced above with `set -a`) — keep DRADIS_API_KEY in .env so the engine and the
# proxy use the SAME value. (Next also auto-loads control-tower/.env.local, but .env
# is the single source of truth that the Rust engine reads too.)
# NEXT_DIST_DIR keeps two instances' build artifacts apart; without it a second
